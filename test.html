            <h3>Why am I seeing a message stating that you will be "phasing out support" for my browser?</h3>
            <p>
                You're seeing this messaging as you are currently viewing this site in an 
                <strong>older browser</strong>. You need to upgrade your browser in order to take advantage of new features that will be released in the future.

            <h3>What do you mean by "phasing out support" for my browser?</h3>
            <p>
                "Phasing out support" just means that as we build and roll out new features, those features will be built for the speed and richness of the latest browsers.
            </p>
            <h3>If I don't upgrade my browser, what will occur?</h3>

                If you 
                <strong>don't upgrade to a recent browser</strong> and continue using an older browser, you may have difficulty using some of our future, advanced features.
